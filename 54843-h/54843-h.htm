up to defend our selves
from such a Calamity; I
most readily undertook the
Task, though upon short
Warning, and with little

Heads of Caution, <i>than a</i>
Set of Directions in Form.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_V'>V</span>The first, <i>which relate

with some new Regulations</i>.
The next, <i>concerning the</i>
suppressing Infection here,
<i>are very different from the
Methods taken in former
Times among</i> Us, <i>and from
what they commonly Do</i> Abroad:
<i>But, I persuade
my self, will be found agreable

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_VI'>VI</span><i>I most heartily wish, that

That the Reasonableness
of any Method, which
shall be proposed to prevent
the spreading of <i>Contagious</i>
Diseases, may the better appear,
it is necessary to premise somewhat
in general concerning <i>Contagion</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_X'>X</span>and the Manner, by which it acts.</p>

<p class='c003'>Contagion is propagated by
three Causes, the <i>Air</i>; <i>Diseased
Persons</i>; and <i>Goods transported from
infected Places</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>We shall therefore first enquire
what alteration of the <i>Air</i> it is,
that makes it <i>infectious</i>; and then,
by what Means it communicates its
noxious Quality to other Bodies.</p>

<p class='c003'>The ancientest and best Authors
of Physick, who lived in a Country
more exposed to these Calamities
than ours, observed the Constitution
of the <i>Air</i>, which preceded
<i>Pestilential Fevers</i>, to be great <i>Heats</i>
attended with much <i>Rain</i> and <i>Southerly
Winds</i><a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a>: And one of Them
takes particular Notice, that no other
than a <i>moist</i> and <i>hot</i> Temperament
of the <i>Air</i> brings the <i>Plague</i>;
and that the Duration of this Constitution
is the Measure of the Violence
of the Distemper<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c007'><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_XI'>XI</span>The Natural History of several
Countries confirms this Observation;
in <i>Africa</i> particularly, if Showers
fall during the sultry Heats of
<i>July</i> and <i>August</i>, the <i>Plague</i> ensues
thereupon, with which whosoever
is infected hardly escapes<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c007'><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c003'>It has besides been remarked in
all Times, that the Stinks of <i>stagnating
Waters</i> in hot Weather, <i>putrid
Exhalations</i> from the Earth;
and above all, the Corruption of
dead <i>Carcasses</i> lying unburied, have
occasioned <i>infectious Diseases</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_XII'>XII</span>From hence it appears to be a
<i>Concurrence</i> of Causes, that produces
Diseases of this Kind; which
must not only meet, but exert their
Force together for a considerable
time. And when this happens,
their first effect is a Degree of <i>Stagnation</i>
in the Air, which is afterwards
followed by <i>Corruption</i> and
<i>Putrefaction</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>And upon this account it is, that
those Countries are chiefly liable to
these Calamities, where not only
the <i>Heats</i> are very great, and the
<i>Weather</i> continues long in the same
State; but the <i>Winds</i> (the Use of
which is by Motion to purify the
Air) do not shift and change so often
as they do in Northern Climates.</p>

<p class='c003'>Indeed <i>Plagues</i> seem to be of the
Growth of the <i>Eastern</i> and <i>Southern</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XIII'>XIII</span>Parts of the World, and to be transmitted
from them into colder Climates
by the Way of <i>Commerce</i>.
Nor do I think, that in this <i>Island</i>
particularly there is any one Instance
of a <i>Pestilential</i> Disease among
us of great Consequence;
which we did not receive from other
<i>infected</i> Places.</p>

<p class='c003'>This I the rather mention, because
it is a common Opinion, and
propagated by Authors of great
Name, that we are usually <i>visited</i>
with the <i>Plague</i> once in 30 or 40
Years; which is a mere Fancy without
any Foundation either in Reason
or Experience: and therefore
People ought to be delivered from
the Subjection to such vain Fears.</p>

<p class='c003'>On the contrary, though we
have had several Strokes of this
kind, yet there are Instances of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XIV'>XIV</span>bad <i>Contagions</i> from abroad being
brought over to us, which have
proved less malignant here by our
Air not being disposed to receive
such Impressions.</p>

<p class='c003'>The <i>Sweating Sickness</i>, called the
<i>Sudor Anglicus</i> and <i>Febris Ephemera
Britannica</i>, because it was commonly
thought to have taken its Rise
here, was most probably of a foreign
Original, and no other than a
<i>Plague</i> abated in its Violence by the
mild Temperament of our Climate.</p>

<p class='c003'>For, we learn from Histories, that
the first time this was felt here,
which was in the Year 1485, it began
in the Army, with which King
<i>Henry</i> VII. came from <i>France</i>,
and landed in <i>Wales</i><a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c007'><sup>[4]</sup></a>; and it was
then thought to have been brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XV'>XV</span>into <i>France</i> from the famous Siege
of <i>Rhodes</i> by the <i>Turks</i> 3 or 4 Years
before. And of the four Returns,
which this has made since that
Time; two, viz. <i>those</i> in the Years
1527, and 1528, may very justly
be suspected to have been owing to
the <i>Pestilence</i>, which at those Times
raged in <i>Italy</i>, particularly at <i>Florence</i>
and <i>Naples</i><a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c007'><sup>[5]</sup></a>. And the others
were very probably from a <i>Turkish</i>
Infection.</p>

<p class='c003'>I call this Distemper a <i>Plague</i>
with lessened Force, because the
Symptoms of it were of that kind,
though in a less Degree; as great
<i>Faintness</i> and <i>Inquietudes</i>, inward
<i>Burning</i>, <i>Pain</i> in the <i>Head</i>, a <i>Delirium</i>
&amp;c. All which were accompanied
with profuse <i>Sweats</i>, and the
Disease lasted but 24 hours. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XVI'>XVI</span>though for want of Care and due
Management many died of it; yet,
as a learned and wise <i>Historian</i><a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c007'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
observes, <i>It appeared rather to be a
surprize of Nature than obstinate to
Remedies, for if the Patient was
kept warm with temperate Cordials,
he commonly recovered</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>And I cannot but take Notice,
as a Confirmation of what I have
been advancing, that we had here
the same kind of Fever in the Year
1713, about the Month of <i>September</i>,
which was called the <i>Dunkirk
Fever</i>, as being brought by
our Soldiers from that Place; where
it was indeed a Malignant Disease
attended with a <i>Diarrhœa</i>, <i>Vomiting</i>,
&amp;c. and probably had its Original
from the Pestilential Distemper,
which some time before broke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XVII'>XVII</span>out at <i>Dantzick</i> and <i>Hamburgh</i>:
But with us was much more mild,
beginning only with a Pain in the
Head, and by very easy Means
went off in large <i>Sweats</i>, after a
Day's Confinement.</p>

<p class='c003'>There being in every Air a
greater Disposition to <i>Contagion</i> at
one Time than another, we have
indeed sometimes felt this Calamity
with greater Fury; as particularly
the last time in the Year 1665;
when it continued in this <i>City</i> about
ten Months, and swept away
by computation 97306 Persons:
But it was generally allowed, that
the <i>Contagion</i> came by <i>Cotton</i> imported
from <i>Turkey</i><a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c007'><sup>[7]</sup></a>; and the long
Duration of it, I believe, may justly
be charged up the unhappy Management
of infected Houses, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XVIII'>XVIII</span>was then directed by Publick Authority;
as I shall shew anon.</p>

<p class='c003'>And the History of the most terrible
of all the Plagues, that ever were
in these Parts of the World, which
was that in the Year 1349, gives
a manifest Proof from whence all
<i>Europe</i> may trace the Origine of
these Evils, viz. from <i>Asia</i>: for
<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c007'><sup>[8]</sup></a>This taking its Rise in <i>China</i> in
the Year 1346, advanced through
the East <i>Indies</i> to <i>Syria</i>, <i>Turkey</i>,
<i>Ægypt</i>, <i>Greece</i>, <i>Africa</i>, &amp;c. In 1347
some Ships from the <i>Levant</i> carried
it to <i>Sicily</i>, <i>Pisa</i>, <i>Genoa</i>, &amp;c. In
1348 it got into <i>Savoy</i>, <i>Provence</i>,
<i>Dauphiny</i>, <i>Catalonia</i>, <i>Castile</i>, &amp;c.
In 1349 it seized <i>England</i>, <i>Scotland</i>,
<i>Ireland</i>, and <i>Flanders</i>; and
in the next place <i>Germany</i>, <i>Hungary</i>,
and <i>Denmark</i>; and in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XIX'>XIX</span>these Countries made most incredible Havock.</p>

<p class='c003'>But to return to the Consideration
of the Air, which we left in a
putrid State: It is to be observed,
that Putrefaction is a kind of Fermentation,
and that all Bodies in
a Ferment emit a volatile active Spirit,
of Power to agitate, and put
into intestine Motions, that is, to
change the Nature of other Fluids
into which it insinuates it self.</p>

<p class='c003'>It were easy to shew from the
best <i>Theory</i> of Fevers<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c007'><sup>[9]</sup></a>, how the
Alterations made in the <i>Blood</i> this
Way will favour <i>Pestilential</i> Diseases,
by rendring the Body obnoxious to
them: But the Digression would
be too great.</p>

<p class='c003'>THIS is one step towards <i>Contagion</i>.
The next, as it seems to me,
proceeds after this Manner. The
Blood in all <i>Malignant Fevers</i>, especially
<i>Pestilential</i> ones, at the latter
End of the Disease, does like
Fermenting Liquors throw off a
great Quantity of active Particles
upon the several <i>Glands</i> of the Body,
particularly upon those of the
Mouth and Skin, from which the
Secretions are naturally the most
constant and large. These, in <i>Pestilential</i>
Cases, although the Air
be in a right State, will generally
infect those, who are very near to
the sick Person; otherwise are soon
dispersed and lost: But when in an
evil Disposition of <i>This</i> they meet
with the subtle Parts, its Corruption
has generated, by uniting
with them they become much more
active and powerful, and likewise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXI'>XXI</span>more durable and lasting, so as to
form an <i>Infectious Matter</i> capable
of conveying the Mischief to a great
Distance from the diseased Body,
out of which it was produced.</p>

<p class='c003'>They who know what strange
Attractions and Combinations are
made by volatile Spirits will understand
this Reasoning; especially if
they consider, how easily all kinds
of <i>Effluvia</i> are diffused in a warm
Air, such as we have described an
Infectious one to be; and further,
of how penetrating a Force the finest
Parts of Animal Juices are; of
which the strange Stench of a mortified
Limb, upon a Body yet living,
will convince any one.</p>

<p class='c003'>A corrupted State of Air is without
doubt necessary to give these
<i>Contagious Atoms</i> their full Force;
for otherwise it were not easy to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXII'>XXII</span>conceive how the <i>Plague</i>, when
once it had seized any Place, should
ever cease, but with the Destruction
of all the Inhabitants: Which
is readily accounted for by supposing
an Emendation of the Qualities
of the Air, and the restoring
of it to a healthy State capable of
dissipating and suppressing the Malignity.</p>

<p class='c003'>On the other hand it is evident,
that <i>Infection</i> is not received from
the Air it self, however predisposed,
without the Concurrence of something
emitted from <i>Infected</i> Persons;
because, by strictly preventing
all Intercourse of Infected Places
with the Neighbourhood, it may
be effectually kept from spreading:
Whereas the least Wind must necessarily
convey whatever noxious
Quality resides in the Air alone,
even to a great Distance. Of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXIII'>XXIII</span>we have had a fresh Proof in the
present unhappy <i>Plague</i> in <i>France</i>,
which, by keeping careful Guard,
was confined for a considerable
Time within the Walls of <i>Marseilles</i>;
so that none of the adjacent
Villages suffered any thing by
it; till at length some Persons
finding Means to escape carried the
Infection along with them. And
we find, they have been able, by
the like Care, still to restrain it
within moderate Bounds.</p>

<p class='c003'>This is the Manner by which
Infectious <i>Effluvia</i> are generated;
The Way, by which a sound Person
receives the Injury, I suppose most
commonly to be this. These <i>Contagious</i>
Particles being drawn in with
the Air we breath, they taint in
their Passage the <i>Salival</i> Juices,
which being swallowed down into
the Stomach presently fix their Malignity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXIV'>XXIV</span>there; as appears from the
<i>Nausea</i> and <i>Vomiting</i>, with which
the Distemper often begins its first
Attacks. Though I make no Question
but the <i>Blood</i> is also more immediately
affected by hurtful Particles
being mixed through Inspiration
with it in the Lungs.</p>

<p class='c003'>The third Way, by which we
mentioned <i>Contagion</i> to be spread, is
by <i>Goods transported from infected
Places</i>. It has been thought so difficult
to explain the Manner of
<i>this</i>, that some Authors have imagined
<i>Infection</i> to be performed by
the Means of <i>Insects</i>, the <i>Eggs</i> of
which may be conveyed from Place
to Place, and make the Disease
when they come to be <i>hatched</i>. As
this is a supposition grounded upon
no manner of Observation, so I
think there is no need to have Recourse
to it. If, as we have conjectured,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXV'>XXV</span>the <i>Matter of Contagion</i>
be an active Substance, perhaps in
the Nature of a <i>Salt</i>, generated
chiefly from the Corruption of a
<i>Humane Body</i>, it is not hard to
conceive how this may be lodged
and preserved in soft, porous Bodies,
which are kept pressed close
together.</p>

<p class='c003'>We all know how long a time
<i>Perfumes</i> hold their <i>Scent</i>, if wrapt
up in proper Coverings: And it is
very remarkable, that the strongest
of these, like the <i>Matter</i> we are
treating of, are mostly <i>Animal</i>
Juices, as <i>Mosch</i>, <i>Civet</i>, &amp;c. and
that the Substances found most fit
to keep them in, are the very same
with those which are most apt to
receive and communicate <i>Infection</i>,
as, <i>Furrs</i>, <i>Feathers</i>, <i>Silk</i>, <i>Hair</i>,
<i>Wool</i>, <i>Cotton</i>, <i>Flax</i>, &amp;c. the greatest
Part of which are likewise of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXVI'>XXVI</span>the Animal Kind; which Remark
alone may serve to lead Us a little
into the true Nature of <i>Contagion</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>From all that has been said, it
appears, I think, very plainly, that
the <i>Plague</i> is a real Poison, which
being bred in the Eastern or Southern
Parts of the World, maintains
it self there by circulating from <i>Infected</i>
Persons to Goods; which is
chiefly owing to the Negligence of
the People in those Countries, who
are stupidly Careless in this Affair:
That when the Constitution of the
Air happens to favour Infection, it
rages there with great Violence;
That at that Time more especially
diseased Persons give it to one another,
and <i>Contagious Matter</i> is lodged
in Goods of a loose and soft
Texture, which being packt up,
and carried into other Countries,
let out, when opened, the imprisoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXVII'>XXVII</span>Seeds of Contagion: And
lastly, That the Air cannot diffuse
and spread these to any great Distance,
if Intercourse and Commerce
with the Place infected be strictly
prevented.</p>

As it is a satisfaction to
know, that the <i>Plague</i> is
not a Native of our Country,
so this is likewise an
Encouragement to the utmost Diligence
in finding out Means to keep
our selves clear from It.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_XXIX'>XXIX</span>This Caution consists of two
Parts: <i>The preventing its being
brought into our Island</i>; And, if
such a Calamity should happen, <i>The
putting a stop to its spreading among
us</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>The first of these is provided
for by the established Method of
obliging Ships, that come from
<i>Infected</i> Places, to <i>perform Quarentine</i>:
As to which I think it necessary,
that the following Rules be
observed.</p>

<p class='c003'>Near to our several Ports, there
should be <i>Lazarettos</i> built in convenient
Places, on little Islands if
it can so be, for the Reception both
of Men and Goods, which arrive
from Places suspected of <i>Infection</i>:
The keeping Men in <i>Quarentine</i>
on board the Ship being not sufficient;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXX'>XXX</span>the only Use of which is to
observe whether any dye among
them. For <i>Infection</i> may be preserved
so long in Cloaths, in which
it is once lodged, that as much,
nay more of it, if Sickness continues
in the Ship, maybe brought
on Shoar at the End than at the beginning
of the 40 Days: Unless
a new <i>Quarentine</i> be begun every
time any Person dies; which might
not end, but with the Destruction
of the whole Ship's Crew.</p>

<p class='c003'>If there has been any <i>Contagious</i>
Distemper in the Ship; The
<i>Sound</i> Men should leave their
Cloaths; which should be burnt;
the Men washed and shaved; and
having fresh Cloaths, should stay
in the <i>Lazaretto</i> 30 or 40 Days.
The reason of this is, because Persons
may be recovered from a Disease
themselves, and yet retain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXXI'>XXXI</span><i>Matter</i> of <i>Infection</i> about them a
considerable Time; as we frequently
see the <i>Small-Pox</i> taken
from those, who have several Days
before passed through the Distemper.</p>

<p class='c003'>The <i>Sick</i>, if there be any, should
be kept in Houses remote from
the <i>Sound</i>; and some time after
they are well, should also be washed
and shaved, and have fresh Cloaths;
whatever they wore while Sick being
burnt: And then being removed
to the Houses of the <i>Sound</i>,
should continue there 30 or 40 days.</p>

<p class='c003'>I am particularly careful to destroy
the <i>Cloaths</i> of the Sick, because
they Harbour the very <i>Quintessence</i>
of <i>Contagion</i>. A very ingenious
Author<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c007'><sup>[10]</sup></a> in his admirable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXXII'>XXXII</span>Description of the <i>Plague</i> at <i>Florence</i>
in the Year 1348, relates
what himself saw: That two <i>Hogs</i>
finding in the Streets the <i>Rags</i>,
which had been thrown out from
off a poor Man dead of the Disease,
after snuffling upon them, and tearing
them with their Teeth, fell
into Convulsions, and dyed in less
than an Hour.</p>

<p class='c003'>If there has been no Sickness in
the Ship, I see no reason why the
Men should perform <i>Quarentine</i>.
Instead of this, they may be washed,
and their Cloaths aired in the <i>Lazaretto</i>,
as Goods, for one Week.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the greatest Danger is from
such <i>Goods</i>, as are apt to retain Infection,
such as <i>Cotton</i>, <i>Hemp</i> and
<i>Flax</i>, <i>Paper</i> or <i>Books</i>, <i>Silk</i> of all
sorts, <i>Linen</i>, <i>Wool</i>, <i>Feathers</i>, <i>Hair</i>,
and all kinds of <i>Skins</i>. The <i>Lazaretto</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXXIII'>XXXIII</span>for these should be at a Distance
from that for the Men,
and they must in convenient Warehouses
be unpackt, and exposed,
as much as may be, to the fresh
Air for 40 Days.</p>

<p class='c003'>This may perhaps seem too long;
but as we don't know how much
Time precisely is necessary to purge
the Interstices of Spongy Substances
from <i>infectious Matter</i> by fresh Air,
the Caution cannot be too great in
this Point: Unless there could be
a Way found out, without hazarding
Men's Lives, of trying when
Bodies have done emitting the
Noxious Fumes; which possibly
might be done by putting tender
<i>Animals</i> near to them, particularly
by setting little <i>Birds</i> upon the exposed
Goods; because it has been
observed in Times of the <i>Plague</i>,
that the Country has been forsaken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXXIV'>XXXIV</span>by the <i>Birds</i>; and those kept in
Houses have many of them dyed<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c007'><sup>[11]</sup></a>.
But the Use of this Fancy Experience
only must shew; for I am
well aware, that all <i>Plagues</i> do not
indifferently affect all Kinds of living
Creatures; on the contrary,
most are confined to a particular
<i>Species</i> of them; like the Disease of
the <i>Black Cattle</i> a few Years since,
which neither proved Infectious
to other Brutes, nor to Men.</p>

<p class='c003'>I take it for granted, that the
<i>Goods</i> should be <i>opened</i>, when they
are put into the <i>Lazaretto</i>, otherwise
their being there will avail
nothing. The Misfortune, which
happened in the Island of <i>Bermudas</i>
about 25 Years since, gives a Proof
of this; where, as the Account
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXXV'>XXXV</span>has been given me by the learned
Dr. <i>Halley</i>, a Sack of <i>Cotton</i>, put
on Shoar by Stealth, lay above a
Month without any Prejudice to
the People of the House, where it
was hid; but when it came to be
distributed among the Inhabitants,
it carried such a <i>Contagion</i> along
with it, that the living scarce sufficed
to bury the Dead.</p>

<p class='c003'>Indeed as it has been frequently
experienced, that of all the Goods,
which harbour <i>Infection</i>, <i>Cotton</i> in
particular is the most dangerous,
and <i>Turkey</i> is almost a perpetual
<i>Seminary</i> of the <i>Plague</i>; I cannot
but think it highly reasonable, that
whatever <i>Cotton</i> is imported from
that Part of the World, should at
all Times be kept in <i>Quarentine</i>;
because it may have imbibed <i>Infection</i>
at the Time of its packing
up, notwithstanding no Mischief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXXVI'>XXXVI</span>has been felt from it by the Ship's
Company.</p>

<p class='c003'>As all reasonable Provisions should
be made both for the <i>Sound</i> and
<i>Sick</i>, who perform <i>Quarentine</i>; so
the strict keeping of it ought to be
inforced by the severest <i>Penalties</i>.
And if a Ship come from any Place,
where the <i>Plague</i> raged, at the Time
of the Ship's Departure from it,
with more than usual Violence, it
will be the securest Method to <i>Burn</i>
all the <i>Goods</i>, and even the <i>Ship</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nor ought this further Caution
to be omitted, That when the <i>Contagion</i>
has ceased in any Place by
the approach of Winter, it will not
be safe to open a free Trade with
It too soon: Because there are Instances
of the <i>Distemper's</i> being
stopt by the Winter Cold, and yet
the Seeds of it not destroyed, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXXVII'>XXXVII</span>only kept unactive, till the Warmth
of the following Spring has given
them new Life and Force. Thus
in the great Plague at <i>Genoa</i> near
60 Years ago, which continued
part of two Years; the first Summer
about 10,000 dyed; the Winter
following hardly any; but the
Summer after no less than 60,000.
So likewise the last <i>Plague</i> at <i>London</i>
began the Autumn before the
Year 1665, and was stopt during
the Winter by a hard Frost of near
three Month's Continuance; so
that there remained no further Appearance
of it till the ensuing
Spring<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c007'><sup>[12]</sup></a>. Now if Goods brought
from such a Place should retain any
of the latent Contagion, there
will be Danger of their producing
the same Mischief in the Place, to
which they are brought, as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XXXVIII'>XXXVIII</span>would have caused in that, from
whence they came.</p>

<p class='c003'>But above all it is necessary, that
the <i>Clandestine Importing</i> of Goods
be punished with the utmost Rigour;
from which wicked Practice
I should at this Time apprehend
more Danger of bringing the <i>Disease</i>
from <i>France</i>, than by any other
Way whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c003'>These are, I think, the most
material Points, to which Regard
is to be had in defending ourselves
against <i>Contagion</i> from other Countries.
The particular Manner of
putting these Directions in Execution,
as the <i>Visiting</i> of <i>Ships</i>, <i>Regulation</i>
of <i>Lazarettos</i>, &amp;c. I leave
to proper Officers, who ought
sometimes to be assisted herein by
able Physicians.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_XXXIX'>XXXIX</span>The next Consideration is, What
to do in Case, through a Miscarriage
in the publick Care, by the Neglect
of Officers, or otherwise, such a
Calamity should be suffered to befall
us.</p>

<p class='c003'>There is no <i>Evil</i> in the World,
in which the great Rule of <i>Resisting
the Beginning</i>, more properly
takes Place, than in the present
Case; and yet it has unfortunately
happened, that the common Steps
formerly taken have had a direct
Tendency to hinder the putting <i>this
Maxim</i> in Practice.</p>

<p class='c003'>As the <i>Plague</i> always breaks out
in some particular Place, it is certain,
that the Directions of the
<i>Civil Magistrate</i> ought to be such,
as to make it as much for the Interest
of Families to discover their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XL'>XL</span>Misfortune, as it is, when a House
is on <i>Fire</i>, to call in the Assistance
of the Neighbourhood: Whereas
on the contrary, the Methods taken
by the Publick, on such Occasions,
have always had the Appearance of
a severe <i>Discipline</i> and even <i>Punishment</i>,
rather than of a <i>Compassionate
Care</i>: Which must naturally
make the <i>Infected</i> conceal the Disease
as long as was possible.</p>

<p class='c003'>The main Import of the <i>Orders</i>
issued out at these Times was, As
soon as it was found, that any House
was infected, to keep it shut up,
with a <i>large red Cross</i>, and <i>Lord
have Mercy upon us</i> on the Door;
and Watchmen attending Day and
Night to prevent any one's going
in or out, except <i>Physicians</i>, <i>Surgeons</i>,
<i>Apothecaries</i>, <i>Nurses</i>, <i>Searchers</i>,
&amp;c. allowed by Authority:
And this to continue at least a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XLI'>XLI</span>Month after all the Family was
<i>dead</i> or <i>recovered</i><a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c007'><sup>[13]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is not easy to conceive a more
dismal Scene of Misery, than this;
Families seized with a Distemper,
which the most of any in the
World requires Help and Comfort,
lockt up from all their Acquaintance;
left it may be to the Treatment
of an inhumane Nurse (for
such are often found at these Times
about the Sick;) and Strangers to
every thing but the Melancholy
sight of the Progress, Death makes
among themselves; with small
Hopes of Life, and those mixed
with Anxiety and Doubt, whether
it be not better to Dye, than to
survive the Loss of their best Friends,
and nearest Relations.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_XLII'>XLII</span>If <i>Fear</i>, <i>Despair</i>, and all <i>Dejection
of Spirits</i> dispose the Body
to receive <i>Contagion</i>, and give it a
great Power, where it is received,
as all Physicians agree they do, I
don't see how a Disease can be
more enforced, than by such a
Treatment.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nothing can justify such <i>Cruelty</i>,
but the Plea, that it is for the
Good of the whole <i>Community</i>,
and prevents the spreading of <i>Infection</i>.
But this upon due Consideration
will be found quite otherwise:
For while <i>Contagion</i> is kept
nursed up in a House, and continually
encreased by the daily Conquests
it makes, it is impossible but
the <i>Air</i> should by Degrees become
<i>tainted</i>, which by opening Windows,
&amp;c. will carry the Malignity
first from House to House;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XLIII'>XLIII</span>and then from one Street to another.
The shutting up Houses in
this Manner is only keeping so many
<i>Seminaries</i> of <i>Contagion</i>, sooner
or later to be dispersed abroad:
For the waiting a Month, or longer,
from the Death of the last Patient
will avail no more, than keeping
a <i>Bale</i> of infected <i>Goods</i> unpack'd;
the Poyson will fly out, whenever
the <i>Pandora's Box</i> is opened.</p>

<p class='c003'>As these Measures were owing to
the Ignorance of the true Nature
of <i>Contagion</i>, so they did, I firmly
believe, contribute very much to
the long Continuance of the <i>Plague</i>,
every time they have been practised
in this City: And no doubt
they have had as ill Effects in other
Countries.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is therefore no wonder, that
great Complaints were sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XLIV'>XLIV</span>made here against this unreasonable
Usage; which, when they prevailed
so far, as to procure some
Release for the <i>Sick</i>, were remarkably
followed with an Abatement
of the Disease. The <i>Plague</i> in the
Year 1636 began with great Violence,
but Leave being given by
the King's Authority for People
to quit their Houses; it was observed,
That <i>not one in twenty of
the well Persons removed fell Sick,
nor one in ten of the Sick dyed</i><a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c007'><sup>[14]</sup></a>.
Which single Instance alone, had
there been no other, should have
been of Weight ever after to determine
the Magistracy against too
strict Confinements. But besides
this, a preceding <i>Plague</i>, viz. in the
Year 1625, affords us another Instance
of a very remarkable Decrease
upon the discontinuing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XLV'>XLV</span><i>shut up</i> Houses. It was indeed so
late in the Year, before this was
done, that the near Approach of
Winter was doubtless one Reason
for the Diminution of the Disease,
which followed: Yet this was so
very great, that it is at least past
dispute, that the Liberty then permitted
was no Impediment to it:
For this <i>opening</i> of the Houses was
allowed of in the beginning of <i>September</i>;
and whereas the last Week
in <i>August</i>, there dyed no less than
4218, the very next Week the
<i>Burials</i> were diminuished to 3344,
and in no longer time than to the
fourth Week after, to 852<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c007'><sup>[15]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c003'>Since therefore the Management
in former Times neither answers
the Purpose of <i>discovering the Beginning</i>
of the <i>Infection</i>, nor of putting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XLVI'>XLVI</span>a stop to it when <i>Discovered</i>,
other Measures are certainly to be
taken; which I think should be of
this Nature.</p>

<p class='c003'>Instead of <i>ignorant old Women</i>,
who are generally appointed <i>Searchers</i>
in Parishes to enquire what Diseases
People dye of, That <i>Office</i>
should be committed to <i>Understanding
and Diligent Men</i>, whose
Business it should be, as soon as
they find any have dyed after an
uncommon Manner, particularly
with <i>livid Spots</i>, <i>Buboes</i>, or <i>Carbuncles</i>,
to give Notice thereof to
the Magistrates; who should immediately
send skilful Physicians to
Visit the Houses in the Neighbourhood,
especially of the <i>Poorer</i> sort,
among whom this Evil generally
begins; and if upon their Report
it appears, that a <i>Pestilential Distemper</i>
is broke out among the Inhabitants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XLVII'>XLVII</span>They should without
Delay order all the Families, in
which the Sickness is, to be <i>Removed</i>;
The Sick to different Places
from the <i>Sound</i>; but the Houses
for both should be three or four
Miles out of Town; and the <i>Sound</i>
People should be <i>stript of all their
Cloaths</i>, and <i>washed</i> and <i>shaved</i>,
before they go into their new Lodgings.</p>

<p class='c003'>No Manner of <i>Compassion</i> and
<i>Care</i> should be wanting to the <i>Diseased</i>;
to whom, being now in <i>clean</i>
and <i>airy</i> Habitations, there would,
with due Cautions, be no great
Danger in giving Attendance. All
Expences should be paid by the
Publick, and no Charges ought to
be thought great, which are counterbalanced
with the saving a Nation
from the greatest of Calamities.
Nor does it seem to me at all unreasonable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XLVIII'>XLVIII</span>that a <i>Reward</i> should
be given to the Person, that makes
the first Discovery of <i>Infection</i> in
any Place; since it is undeniable,
that the making known the <i>Evil</i>
to those, who are provided with
proper Methods against it, is the
first and main Step towards the overcoming
it.</p>

<p class='c003'>When the <i>Sick Families</i> are gone,
all the Goods of the Houses, in
which they were, should be <i>burnt</i>;
nay the Houses themselves, if that
can conveniently be done. And
after this all possible Care ought
still to be taken to remove whatever
Causes are found to breed and promote
<i>Contagion</i>. In order to this,
the <i>Overseers</i> of the Poor (who
might be assisted herein by other
Officers) should visit the Dwellings
of all the meaner sort of the Inhabitants,
and where they find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XLIX'>XLIX</span>them <i>stifled up too close</i> and <i>nasty</i>,
should lessen their Number by sending
some into better Lodgings,
and should take Care, by all Manner
of Provision and Encouragement,
to make them more <i>cleanly</i>
and <i>sweet</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>No good Work carries its own
Reward with it so much as this
kind of <i>Charity</i>; and therefore be
the Expence what it will, it must
never be thought unreasonable. For
nothing approaches so near to the
first Original of <i>Contagion</i>, as Air
pent up, loaded with Damps, and
corrupted with the Filthiness, that
proceeds from <i>Animal Bodies</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>Our common <i>Prisons</i> afford us
an Instance of this, in which very
few escape, what they call the
<i>Gaol Fever</i>, which is always attended
with a Degree of <i>Malignity</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_L'>L</span>in proportion to the <i>Closeness</i> and
<i>Stench</i> of the Place: And it would
certainly very well become the Wisdom
of the Government, as well
with Regard to the Health of the
<i>Town</i>, as in Compassion to the <i>Prisoners</i>,
to take Care, that all <i>Houses
of Confinement</i> should be kept as
Airy and Clean, as is consistent
with the Use, to which they are
designed.</p>

<p class='c003'>The <i>Black Assize</i> at <i>Oxford</i>,
held in the Castle there in the
Year 1577, will never be forgot<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c007'><sup>[16]</sup></a>;
at which the <i>Judges</i>, <i>Gentry</i>, and
almost all that were present, to the
Number of 300, were killed by a
<i>poysonous Steam</i>, thought by some
to have broke forth from the <i>Earth</i>;
but by a <i>noble</i> and <i>great</i> Philosopher<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c007'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_LI'>LI</span>more justly supposed to have been
brought by the <i>Prisoners</i> out of the
<i>Goal</i> into <i>Court</i>; it being observed,
that they alone were not injured
by it.</p>

<p class='c003'>At the same time, that this
Care is taken of <i>Houses</i>, the proper
Officers should be strictly charged
to see that the <i>Streets</i> be washed
and kept clean from <i>Filth</i>, <i>Carrion</i>,
and all Manner of <i>Nusances</i>; which
should be carried away in the <i>Night
Time</i>; nor should the <i>Laystalls</i> be
suffered to be too near the City.
<i>Beggars</i> and <i>Idle Persons</i> should be
taken up, and such miserable Objects,
as are neither fit for the
common <i>Hospitals</i>, nor <i>Work-houses</i>,
should be provided for in an <i>Hospital
of Incurables</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>Orders indeed of this kind are
necessary to be observed at all times,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_LII'>LII</span>especially in populous Cities; and
therefore I am sorry to take Notice,
that in <i>these</i> of <i>London</i> and
<i>Westminster</i> there is no good <i>Police</i>
established in these Respects;
for want of which the Citizens and
Gentry are every Day annoyed
more ways than one.</p>

<p class='c003'>If these early <i>Precautions</i>, we
have mentioned, take Effect, there
will be no need of any Methods
for <i>Correcting the Air</i>, <i>Purifying
Houses</i>, or of <i>Rules for preserving
particular Persons from Infection</i>: To
all which, if the <i>Plague</i> get head,
so that the <i>Sick</i> are too many to be
removed, Regard must be had.</p>

<p class='c003'>As to the <i>first</i>; <i>Fire</i> has been almost
universally recommended for
this Purpose, both by the Ancients
and Moderns; who have advised
to make frequent and numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_LIII'>LIII</span><i>Fires</i> in the Towns infected:
By which Means, it is said, <i>Hippocrates</i>
preserved <i>Greece</i> from a
<i>Plague</i>, which was entring into it
from <i>Æthiopia</i><a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c007'><sup>[18]</sup></a>. And it is certain,
that some evil Dispositions of
the Air, particularly such as proceed
from <i>Damps</i>, <i>Exhalations</i>,
&amp;c. may be corrected by <i>Fire</i>,
and the Predisposition of it to
receive <i>Infection</i> from these Causes
sometimes removed. But when the
Distemper is actually <i>begun</i>, and
rages, since it is known to be
<i>spread</i> and <i>increased</i> by the <i>Heat</i>
of the <i>Summer</i>, and on the contrary
checked by the <i>cold</i> in <i>Winter</i>;
undoubtedly, whatever increases
that <i>Heat</i> will so far add Force to
the Disease. Whether the Service
<i>Fires</i> may do by correcting any
other ill Qualities of the Air will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_LIV'>LIV</span>counterbalance the Inconvenience
upon this Account, Experience only
can determine; and the Fatal
success of the Tryals made here
in the last <i>Plague</i>, is more than
sufficient to discourage any further
Attempts of this Nature; for <i>Fires</i>
being ordered in all the <i>Streets</i> for
three Days together, there dyed
in one Night following no less than
4000; whereas in any single Week
before or after, not much above
three times that Number were carryed
off<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c007'><sup>[19]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c003'>What has been said of <i>Fires</i>, is
likewise to be understood of <i>firing
of Guns</i>, which some have too rashly
advised. The proper Correction
of the Air would be to make it
<i>fresh</i> and <i>cool</i>. Accordingly the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_LV'>LV</span><i>Arabians</i><a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c007'><sup>[20]</sup></a>, who were best acquainted
with the Nature of <i>Pestilences</i>,
advise People to keep themselves
as <i>airy</i> as possible, and to chuse
Dwellings exposed to the Wind.</p>

<p class='c003'>For keeping <i>Houses</i> cool, they
took to be the best Method of
<i>purifying</i> them; and therefore to
answer this End more fully, they
directed to strew them with <i>cooling</i>
Herbs, as <i>Roses</i>, <i>Violets</i>, <i>Water-Lillies</i>,
&amp;c. and to be washed with
<i>Water</i> and <i>Vinegar</i>; than all which,
especially the last, nothing more
proper can be proposed: Though
it be directly contrary to what Modern
Authors mostly advise, which
is to make Fumes with hot Things,
as <i>Benzoin</i>, <i>Frankincense</i>, <i>Asa Fœtida</i>,
<i>Storax</i>, &amp;c. from which I
see no reason to expect any Virtue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_LVI'>LVI</span>to destroy the Matter of <i>Infection</i>,
or to keep particular Places from a
Disposition to receive it; which are
the only things here to be aimed
at. It is of more Consequence to
be observed, that as <i>Nastiness</i> is a
great Source of <i>Infection</i>, so <i>Cleanliness</i>
is the greatest Preservative:
Which is the true Reason, why the
Poor are most obnoxious to Disasters
of this Kind.</p>

<p class='c003'>The next thing after the <i>purifying
of Houses</i>, is to consider by what
Means particular <i>Persons</i> may best
defend themselves against <i>Contagion</i>;
for the effectual doing of which
it would be necessary to put the
<i>Humours</i> of the <i>Body</i> into such a
State, as not to be alterable by the
<i>Matter of Infection</i>. But since this
is no more to be hoped for, than
a <i>Specific Preservative</i> from the
<i>Small-Pox</i>; the most that can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_LVII'>LVII</span>done, will be to keep the <i>Body</i> in
such Order, that it may suffer as
little as possible. The <i>first Step</i> towards
which, is to maintain a good
State of Health, in which we are
always least liable to suffer by any
external Injuries; and not to weaken
the Body by Evacuations. The
<i>next</i> is, to guard against all <i>Dejection
of Spirits</i>, and <i>immoderate Passions</i>;
for these we daily observe do
expose Persons to the more common
<i>Contagion</i> of the <i>Small-Pox</i>.
These Ends will be best answered
by living with Temperance upon a
good generous Diet, and avoiding
<i>Fastings</i>, <i>Watchings</i>, <i>extreme Weariness</i>,
&amp;c. <i>Another</i> Defence is, to
use whatever Means are proper to
keep the <i>Blood</i> from <i>Inflaming</i>.
This, if it does not secure from
<i>contracting Infection</i>, will at least
make the <i>Effects</i> of it less violent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_LVIII'>LVIII</span>The most proper Means for this,
according to the Advice of the
<i>Arabian</i> Physicians, is the repeated
Use of <i>acid Fruits</i>, as <i>Pomegranates</i>,
<i>Sevil Oranges</i>, <i>Lemons</i>, <i>tart
Apples</i>, &amp;c. But above all of <i>Wine-Vinegar</i>
in small Quantities, rendered
grateful to the Stomach by
the Infusion of some such Ingredients
as <i>Gentian Root</i>, <i>Galangal</i>,
<i>Zedoary</i>, <i>Juniper Berries</i>, &amp;c. Which
Medicines by correcting the <i>Vinegar</i>,
and taking off some ill Effects
it might otherwise have upon the
Stomach, will be of good Use:
But these, and all other hot <i>Aromatic</i>
Drugs, though much recommended
by Authors, if used alone,
are most likely to do hurt by <i>over
heating</i> the Blood.</p>

<p class='c003'>But since none of these Methods
promise any certain Protection; as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_LIX'>LIX</span><i>leaving</i> the Place infected is the
surest <i>Preservative</i>, so the next to
it, is to avoid, as much as may be,
the <i>near Approach</i> to the <i>Sick</i>, or
to such as have but <i>lately Recovered</i>.
For the greater Security herein,
it will be advisable to avoid all
<i>Crouds of People</i>. Nay it should
be the Care of the <i>Magistrate</i> to
prohibit all unnecessary <i>Assemblies</i>;
and likewise to oblige all, who get
over the Disease, to <i>Confine</i> themselves
for some time, before they
appear abroad.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Advice to keep at a Distance
from the <i>Sick</i>, is also to be
understood of the <i>Dead Bodies</i>:
which should be <i>buried</i> at as great
a Distance from Dwelling Houses,
as may be; put <i>deep</i> in the Earth;
and <i>covered</i> with the exactest Care.
They should likewise be <i>carried out</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_LX'>LX</span>in the <i>Night</i>, while they are yet
fresh and free from Putrefaction:
Because a Carcass not yet beginning
to Corrupt, if kept from the
Heat of the Day, hardly emits any
kind of Steam or Vapour.</p>

<p class='c003'>As for those, who must of necessity
attend the <i>Sick</i>; some further
Directions should be added for
their Use. These may be comprehended
in two short Precepts.
<i>One</i> is, not to <i>swallow their Spittle</i>
while they are about the <i>Sick</i>, but
rather to <i>spit</i> it out: <i>The other</i>, not
so much as to <i>draw in their Breath</i>,
when they are very near them.
The reason for both these appears
from what has been said above concerning
the Manner, in which a
sound Person receives the Infection.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_LXI'>LXI</span>This is the Sum of what I think
most likely to stop the Progress of
the <i>Disease</i> in any Place, where it
shall have got Admittance. If some
few of these <i>Rules</i> refer more particularly
to the City of <i>London</i>,
with small Alteration they may be
applied to any other <i>Place</i>. It
now remains therefore only to lay
down some Directions to hinder
the <i>Distemper's</i> spreading from <i>Town</i>
to <i>Town</i>. The best Method for
which, where it can be done, is
to cast up a <i>Line</i> about the <i>Town
infected</i>, at a convenient Distance;
and by placing a <i>Guard</i>, to hinder
People's passing from it without
due Regulation, to other
Towns: But not absolutely to forbid
any to withdraw themselves, as
they have now done in <i>France</i>, according
to the usual Practice abroad;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_LXII'>LXII</span>which is an unnecessary Severity,
not to call it a Cruelty. I think it
will be enough, if all, who desire
to pass the <i>Line</i>, be permitted to do
it, upon Condition they first perform
<i>Quarantine</i> for about 20 Days
in <i>Tents</i>, or other more convenient
<i>Habitations</i>. But the greatest
Care must be taken, that none
pass without conforming themselves
to this Order, both by keeping diligent
<i>Watch</i>, and by <i>punishing</i>
with the utmost Severity, any that
shall either have done so, or attempt
it. And the better to discover
<i>such</i>, it will be requisite to oblige
all, who travel in any Part
of the Country, under the same
Penalties, to carry with them <i>Certificates</i>
either of their coming from
Places not <i>Infected</i>, or of their passing
the <i>Line</i> by permission.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_LXIII'>LXIII</span>This I take to be a more effectual
Method to keep the <i>Infection</i>
from spreading, than the absolute
refusing a Passage to People upon
any Terms. For when Men are
in such imminent Danger of their
Lives, where they are; many, no
doubt, if not otherwise allowed to
escape, will use Endeavours to do
it secretly, let the Hazard be ever
so great. And it can hardly be,
but some will succeed in their Attempts;
as we see fell out in <i>France</i>
notwithstanding all their Care. But
one that gets off thus clandestinely,
will be more like to carry the
Distemper with him, than twenty,
nay a hundred, that go away under
the preceding Restrictions: Especially
because the <i>Infection</i> of
the Place, he flies from, will by
this Management be rendered much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_LXIV'>LXIV</span>more intense. For confining People,
and shutting them up together
in great Numbers, will make the
Distemper rage with augmented
Force, even to the increasing it beyond
what can be easily imagined;
As appears from the <i>Account</i>,
which the learned <i>Gassendus</i><a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c007'><sup>[21]</sup></a> has
given us of a memorable <i>Plague</i>,
which happened at <i>Digne</i> in <i>Provence</i>,
where he lived, in the Year
1619. This was so terrible, that
in one <i>Summer</i> out of <i>ten thousand</i>
Inhabitants, it left but <i>fifteen hundred</i>,
and of them all but <i>five</i> or
<i>six</i> had gone through the <i>Disease</i>.
And he assigns <i>this</i>, as the principal
Cause of the great Destruction,
That the Citizens were too closely
confined, and not suffered so much
as to go to their Country Houses.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_LXV'>LXV</span>Whereas in another <i>Pestilence</i>, which
broke out in the same Place a year
and half after, more Liberty being
allowed, there did not dye above
<i>one hundred</i> Persons.</p>

<p class='c003'>For these Reasons, I think, to
allow People with proper <i>Cautions</i>
to remove from an infected Place,
is the best Means to suppress the
<i>Contagion</i>, as well as the most
humane Treatment of the present
Sufferers: But though Liberty ought
to be given to the <i>People</i>, yet no
sort of <i>Goods</i> must by any means be
suffered to be carried over the
<i>Line</i>, which are made of <i>Materials</i>
retentive of <i>Infection</i>. For
in the present Case, when <i>Infection</i>
has seized any Part of a
Country, much greater Care ought
to be taken, that no <i>Seeds</i> of the
<i>Contagion</i> be conveyed about, than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_LXVI'>LXVI</span>when the Distemper is at a great
Distance; because a <i>Bale of Goods</i>,
which shall have imbibed the <i>Contagious
Aura</i> when packt up in
<i>Turkey</i>, or any remote Parts; yet,
when unpackt here, may chance
to meet with so healthful a Temperament
of our Air, that it shall
not do much hurt. But when
the Air of any one of our Towns
shall be so corrupted, as to spread
and maintain the <i>Pestilence</i> in it,
there will be little reason to believe,
that the Air of the rest of the
Country is in a much better State.</p>

<p class='c003'>For the same Reason <i>Quarentines</i>
should more strictly be enjoined,
when the <i>Plague</i> is in a
bordering Kingdom, than when it
is more remote.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_LXVII'>LXVII</span>I have gone through the chief
Branches of <i>Preservation</i> against
the <i>Plague</i>. And shall only add,
that if the <i>Burning of Goods</i>, which
has been proposed, be thought any
Way <i>offensive</i> or <i>inconvenient</i>,
The <i>Burying</i> of them six Feet, or
more, under Ground may answer
the Purpose as well.</p>

<p class='c003'>What has been said of the <i>Nature
of Contagion</i>, upon which the
foregoing Directions are grounded,
may also be of Use towards establishing
a better Method of
<i>Cure</i>, than <i>Authors</i> have commonly
taught: But to engage in this
is beyond the present Design.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
